# __Experiment Project Documentation__  
## __Introduction__  
This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

### __Project__ 
__Domain Name__ : Computer Science & Engineering
__Lab Name__ : Problem Solving  
__Experiment Name__ : Beauty of Numbers

While learning to code, it is a very important aspect to be able to see previous submissions while solving a problem. For this a submission history page would serve a large purpose.


## __Purpose of the project__   
To add a log submission functionality to the simulation editor.

## __Process Followed to do the experiment__
Identified how to capture the entered data  
Understood how it must be stored  
Linked the two using flask and some libraries


## __Value Added by our Project__
Users can see their previous submissions and learn from their mistakes

## __Risks and Challenges__
Figuring out how to work out sqlite and flask and launching a seerver on my computer.
