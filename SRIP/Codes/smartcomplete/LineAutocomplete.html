<!--
* HTML body for Autocomplete
* This is a one line autocomplete that can be extended to a full text area
* by simply adding more cases to recognize commands in the script (such as
* after every space, bracket, period, etc.
* The same could also be extended for the editarea specifically by just
* changing how the textarea value is accessed in the script.
*
* The initial plan with the idea was to do just that as the next step.
*
* The stylesheet on this is a work in progress, but all features in script
* work apart from arrow key navigation.
